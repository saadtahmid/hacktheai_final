# 🚀 Hackathon Copilot Guide

This project is being built for a **hackathon**, and all code/suggestions from Copilot must align with the judging criteria.  

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Prototype & Design
- Always start with **frontend prototypes first**.  
- Build **intuitive, smooth, and consistent UI/UX**.  
- Ensure **visual appeal and accessibility** across all components.  

---

## 🗄 Database & Architecture
- Create and review **ER diagrams** before implementing queries.  
- Provide **activity diagrams** or clear workflows for architecture.  
- **Do not write queries** until the schema is reviewed and confirmed.  

---

## ⚙️ Features
- **Small Features:** Multiple useful, well-polished implementations.  
- **Big Feature:** At least one **innovative, deep feature** that stands out.  
- Features must be **tested, relevant, and reliable**.  

---

## 💡 Idea Usability & Uniqueness
- Ensure the solution is **practical, useful, and original**.  
- Focus on **real-world usability** and avoid generic clones.  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Code Quality & Documentation
- Code must be **clean, modular, and scalable**.  
- Provide **clear documentation and inline comments**.  
- Always explain **customization options** for features.  

---

## 🔌 SmythOS API Usage
- Use the **SmythOS API** in a **meaningful and innovative way**.  
- Avoid relying only on basic functions—show creativity.  

---

## ✅ Implementation & Demo
- Ensure all features **work as expected**.  
- Provide **demo-ready examples**, using mock data if necessary.  
- Keep customization **easy and flexible**.  

---

## 📊 Presentation
- Explanations must follow a logical order: **problem → solution → demo**.  
- Highlight **usability, innovation, and UI/UX quality**.  
- Summarize: *what was built, how it works, why it matters*.

## 📝 Workflow for Copilot
1. **Frontend First** → Build UI components with mock data.  
2. **Backend APIs Second** → Define endpoints to match frontend needs.  
3. **Database Last** → Review schema, then implement queries.  
4. Always explain how each solution **meets hackathon judging metrics**.  

---

⚡ **Reminder:** Focus on **clarity, usability, and innovation** over complexity.
